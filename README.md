# LCBO_checker
Checks if a rare item is in stock at the LCBO

Has two options of notifying you, either via email, or creating a file on your desktop.

You can set the items to check by adding them into the links.txt file.

- *To write the file results change the directory on line 203, right now it's a placeholder.*
- *To use the email sending function, change the placeholder info on line 185.*

*Note: To use the email client on gmail, you'll have to enable using unverified third party email applications, which is disabled by default.*
